PowerBi Module Project as a part of Data Science Certification
An in-depth Analysis

Through the documentation, I would try to dive deeper into the insights that have been derived from the data sample that was part of the Project. The Financial sample that was under consideration represented the sales information related to a variety of Products sold across varying Segments ranging from Government, small and mid-level businesses to Enterprises of much larger proportions. The possibility to observe varying products on the basis of offered discount band is definitely insightful. 
At the end of the day, all comes down to brass tax. How much money do the Stakeholders make? Profits are the absolute goal of any business Organization. But I would leap ahead to add a word to that conversation, ‘Sustainability’. Yes, Sustained profits are the absolute goal of businesses to ensure growth and future market capitalization. To ensure that growth continues in future, it is necessary to understand current trends as well as predict future ones. But the same time, it is also quite useful to look at sales figures to see which of your organizations Products make and loose use the most money or which ones sell most consistently or what the production cost across your Product range looks like. This might lead to present day optimization of Production lines, delivery methods, partner companies that help fulfill those services, necessity and reach of discounts offered and so on.
Visualization of the provided Data helped understand these present day cues that absolutely can give constructive feedback to our stakeholders in improving profit margins and decide where to invest for future as well as where to deinvest in certain cases.
The dataset provided was visualized into several categories to better understand the scope of it and this provided valuable insights into what is currently making the stakeholder the most money and what is loosing them the most
